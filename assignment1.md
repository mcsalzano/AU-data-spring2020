## Military Recruiting in High Schools.

In 2018, the Army missed its recruiting goal for the first time snce 2005. For 2019, it launched an effort to increase recruitment by starting in high schools in 22 cities. Using data, I would be interested to see which schools it targeted, which schools it had the most luck with, and what factors may have contributed to students coming out of those high schools wanting to join the military. What tactics are recruiters using with students? How much influence should the government have over our children and their futures?

#### [The Military Targets Youth for Recruiting, Especially at Poor Schools](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/the-military-targets-youth-for-recruitment) 
##### Teen Vogue, Jan. 22, 2019

###### Objective: Clarity and accuracy
* 5 - "The Military Targets Youth for Recriting, Especially at poor Schools" claims that the Military targets poorer students and the article outlines the Military's efforts to do so.
* 2 _ The biggest critique was that there were no graphics to list out the data. In the beginning there was a lot of history that could have benefited from a timeline. Towards the middle and end the article listed out a lot of data points in text that could have been more clearly outlined with a chart or graph. That would halso have given the opportunity to give more context of the data.
* 4 - The data wa clearly cited but I would have liked to see more trend data for context. The article only cited data results fom 2017.

###### Objective: Quality
* 5 - It had a good mix of data, background research and interviews. The lede was a little long which I'm not sure wa the most important information to the story. It could have included a graphic and more context data to show trends of how the relationship between the Military and America's youth is changing.
* A data story mst present any pertinent data in a clear and engaging way. It must also allow for context to give the reader an unbiased picture of what the data is saying and give the "why." For example, the story claims that "According to a 2017 poll conducted by the Department of Defense, only 14% of respondents age 16 to 24 said it was likely they’d serve in the military in the next few years," but doesn't give any explanation to why. 

###### Objective: Creativity
* 2 - Not really. The headline picture was of a line of soldiers who looked about 12, which could draw some people in. But other than that, it was large blocks of text with hyperlinks to sources.

## How Much Money Spend or Make on the Criminalization and Decriminalization of Marijuana?

Nationwide, there are hundreds of thousands of incarcerated people due to marijuana charges. But in states where the substance has become legalized for recreational use like Coorado, it has become a top luxury consumer good accounting for large percentages of state tax income and creating ne microeconomies. We also know that the U.S. prison system employs penal labor for prisoners. Using Colorado as an example, I would like to compare the amounts of money the states spends and used to make imprisoning people from marijuana-specific crimes with the amount the state now makes on its marijuana tax. Which solution is more profitable?

#### [Where does Colorado’s marijuana tax money go? The state made a flow chart to answer the $1 billion question](https://coloradosun.com/2019/06/12/where-does-colorados-marijuana-tax-money-go/)
##### Colorado Sun, Jun. 12, 2019

###### Objective: Clarity and accuracy
* 5 - "Where does Colorado’s marijuana tax money go? The state made a flow chart to answer the $1 billion question" clearly asks a question and tells the reader that it has been answered
* 5 - The background information was presented in short, concise paragraph broken up by large, colorful graphics to clarify the information. I can't think of any ways to improve the navigation. It wa a relatively short story. All of the immediate questions that came up for me while reading it were answered as I kept reading.
* 4 - The data graphics came directly from the governemt. I would suggest requesting FOIA documents to double check, since the government can make graphics to portray what they want. The background data seemed sound and they attributed it.

###### Objective: Quality
* 5 - The information was presented clearly and concisely. More context is always great but for a breaking news story it provided enough background and was easy to understand.
* Present its data uniasedly and clearly.

###### Objective: Type and color
* The flow chart was clear in its structure. The color differentiation took me a minute to understand.
* They could have made the tax circle larger or more prominent to make it clearer that that is where the money was coming from. I thought it was all coming from the middle orange circle and cycling around at first.
* Arbitrary colors and shapes I think, but it did make iteasier to read.

###### Objective: Crativity
* 4 - The headline and photo were attention grabbing. It was broken up well by the graphics so easliy digestible. It seemed like they got a bunch of graphics from the state and slapped them toegther, so it didn't require much other work on their end besides writing up the article and putting it together. But it was easy to consume and gave me the information I was looking for, quickly.
