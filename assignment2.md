The death penalty is a punishment used to convict the most heinous crimes, especially rape, murder or a combination of the two. 

Twenty-one U.S. states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have abolished the death penalty for prisoners, including Alaska, Connectiut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusettes, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York North Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. States like Alaska has never had the death penalty.

The sentance is still present in 31 states but, due to the shortage of production and rising costs of drugs used in the lethal injection cocktails. Some states are considering other methods.

The Eigth Amendment states that, "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."

Activits constitute botched executions and the seven-minute-long death from lethal injection as "cruel and unusual." Proponents of the death penalty feel it's unjust for tax dollars to pay for the prison living expenses for those who have raped and murdered with no remorse. But which is cheaper, to sustain someone in the prison system or to execute them? Which method is the most overall constitutional?
