The death penalty is a punishment used to convict the most heinous crimes, especially rape, murder or a combination of the two. 

Twenty-one U.S. states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have abolished the death penalty for prisoners, including Alaska, Connectiut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusettes, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York North Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. States like Alaska has never had the death penalty.

The sentance is still present in 31 states but, due to the shortage of production and rising costs of drugs used in the lethal injection cocktails. Some states are considering other methods.

The Eigth Amendment states that, "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."

Activits constitute botched executions and the seven-minute-long death from lethal injection as "cruel and unusual." Proponents of the death penalty feel it's unjust for tax dollars to pay for the prison living expenses for those who have raped and murdered with no remorse. But which is cheaper, to sustain someone in the prison system or to execute them? 

Here are the features I'll be collecting and why:
* The state
* The general prison population
* The average amount of tax-payer dollars the state spends per prisoner per year
* The Death Row inmate population
* The average age of a Death Row prisoner by state
* The average life expectancy of of that Death Row prisoner based on the average age condemned and the estimated lifespan a prisoner would have before dying of natural causes
* The average amount of years a Death Row prisoner spends awaiting execution using tax-payer dollars
* The amount of tax-payer dollars for an execution regarding the lethal injection chemicals and legal fees for a Death Row trial
* The estimated cost of a life without parole sentence based on the average age of a Death Row prisoner and the estimated life expectancy for them to die of natural causes
* ^I will be collecting data on Maryland as an example of a state who has done extnesive research on this and concluded that that death penalty should be abolished

I will collect the data by reviewing public prison records state-by-state including inmate rosters and budget summarys, and look through the following sources to find information about the costs of execution: [The Death Penalty vs. Life Incarceration: A Financial Analysis](https://scholarlycommons.susqu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=supr), [Death Penalty Information Center](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/costs-death-penalty-costs-in-texas-outweigh-life-imprisonment), [The Cost of the Death Penalty in Maryland](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/files/pdf/CostsDPMaryland.pdf), [KRCG](https://krcgtv.com/news/local/the-cost-of-capital-punishment), [The Florida Bar](https://www.floridabar.org/the-florida-bar-news/take-a-hard-look-at-the-real-cost-of-the-death-penalty/), [SC Now](https://www.scnow.com/news/local/the-death-penalty-and-south-carolina-capital-cases-involve-many/article_344da748-1d17-11e5-a103-3b27a5ebc821.html)
