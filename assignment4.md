Hed: Altria Stock Falls After FDA Prioritizes Crack Downs on Juul Flavors

Nut graf:  Altria stock (MO), parent company of Juul Labs, fell 5.6% this week amidst crackdowns from the FDA to limit Juul pod flavors. The FDA is also threatening to regulate the nicotine content Juul is allowed to put in its pods.

With a potential White House transition coming up this year, both the lawmakers and their new policies are volatile. According to the FEC, Juul Labs, Inc., PAC has shifted its efforts to backing Republicans, giving a total of $42,500 since the beginning of the 2020 fiscal year. Before then, its donations went almost exclusively to Democrats. 


The shift in allegiance could be because Republicans often favor cutting regulations and limiting FDA funding but to follow up on my story I would do more research on the exact policies Juul is supporting. I would also look into what Juul Labs spent money lobbying for on the Senate lobbying portal, look at former press statements from Juul or the candidates about vaping. This story would likely take 1-2 days to report.

In order to find my story I:
1. Searchd the FEC website for Juul Labs, Inc., and found its PAC.
2. Imported the data from the past year into an excel sheet and cleaned.
3. Compared Juul's contributions by party:
  * Took the sum of the positive and negative contributions to Republicans
  * Took the sum of the positive and negative contributions to Democrats
