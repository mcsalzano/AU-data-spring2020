I plan to analyze the population affects of hurricane Michael in the Panama City, Florida/Panhandle area versus the amount of funding and rebuilding they have done since the storm in 2018. How many people are still in the area? How many people have left? Why did they stay? What are their living conditions like? What is the city's plan to bring infrastructure back to the area? How are the people dealing with their living conditions? This will also speak to the culture of the area. I'm also interested in comparing the distaster releif efforts given to this relatively low-income area of devastation that was hit by the third hardest hurricane to make landfall in history to other areas like Miami or Los Angeles.

To do this, I will use Census data on the area and budget data from FEMA from different areas.

I could visualize the area itself, using before and after photos as well as the percent of people moved to mobile homes or displaced from their homes, as well as the population change over time.

This is timely because $735 million was just approved to fund Hurricane Michael-affected areas.

For sources, I could talk to government officials and people in the community.
