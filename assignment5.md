I plan to analyze how much it cost for the state of Florida to house prisoners for life versus how much it costs to try and execute people on death row. I would also like to compare those costs to how much states that have abolished the death penalty are saving.

To do this, I will use prison record data and studies on how much it costs to house inmates, as well as studies on how much legal fees and drugs cocktails cost for execution and compare the two.

I could visualize the cost per inmate or the cost differences.

This is timely because the Florida Supreme Court just ruled it unconstitutional to execute people if the jury vote was not unanimous, so they are currently retrying all of the death row inmates. I would also like to find out how much it cost the state to do that. What is the state plannig to do instead? Thomas McCoy was just recently found guilty and sentenced to death again, so I would focus on the costs of his case.

For sources, I could talk to government officials or prison spokespeople to find out how the government is handling it, locals and people affected by Thomas McCoy's crimes feel about the death penalty, try and reach out to Thomas McCoy and/or his to hear his story.
