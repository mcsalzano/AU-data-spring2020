I went into this data wanting to know (1) if homelessness in Florida was rising or falling and (2) what the change was like compared to the national change.

* Downloaded data.
* Unmerged all horizontally merged cells
* Filled in blanks using =if(isblank()) function and pasted values
* Formatted all cells to read as numbers not scientific
* created a new sheet with homeless population and city data
* Added percent change rows for each year using (new-old)/new * 100
* Added total percent change row

In most cities, homelessness was falling. The national change according to endhomlessness.org is +0.7%. 

Next I looked at which cities were rising, especially rapidly, and why. Panama City rose almost 54%, 28% over the last year. This is most likely due to Hurricane Michael, the devastation, and the slow rebuilding in the area. This is interesting because some of the cities on peninsular Florida do not show this even though they are more frequently affected by hurricanes and harsh weather. It could be because there is more money in those areas tp rebuild, more money in general or they are more equipped for storms.

Homelessness Up 28% in the Wake of Hurricane Michael in Panama City

PANAMA CITY, FLORIDA - A little over a year after Hurricane Michael hit the pandhandle, rebuilding has been slow leaving Panama City in a state of ruin and forcing hundreds from their homes. Census data shows a 28% jump in homelessness since the storm hit in October of 2018. Last week, Governor Ron DeSantis announced more than $735 million in disaster recovery funding for areas affected by the storm.
