# Hurricane Michael Hit the Forgotten Coast in 2018, But We Can't Forget About Its Students

### After the Category 5 Hurricane ripped through the Florida panhandle 16 months ago, school systems are still recovering.

Tom Lewis grew up in Panama City, Florida. When he was younger, all he wanted to do was get out. After attending graduate school in Tallahassee and working in Miami, eventually, the white sand beaches called him back to raise his family and build his career as the news director of his hometown’s local news station, WMBB. “That stands for World’s Most Beautiful Beaches,” Lewis, 62, said. “It’s true!”

In 2018, those beaches were slammed by the third most powerful hurricane in history. Hurricane Michael caused billions of dollars in damage to  Florida’s forgotten coast before making its way north up to the county’s more rural areas, not only destroying gas stations and grocery stores, but also majorly disrupting the school systems. The rebuilding has been slow, which has led to growing homelessness and declining school enrollment.

Data from Florida’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research tracking Florida’s public school enrollment over the past 10 years shows sudden declines over some years.  

Hurricane Michael made landfall on Florida’s Forgotten Coast on Oct. 10 devastating the area, in particular Bay County. 

Since Hurricane Michael, Bay County has seen a 6% decline in public school enrollment from the 2017/2018 school year to the 2018/2019 school year for grades pre-kindergarten through 12, according to data released by Florida’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research. This amounts to about 1,630 students who were not in school compared to the year before. 

The Gulf County and Calhoun County school systems each lost over 70 students, equivalent to 3.7% and 3.4% declines in enrollment, respectively, since last year. Jackson County saw a 1.9% decline amounting to about 122 students. All of these counties were pounded by Hurricane Michael 16 months ago.

According to the 2017/2018 Census Bureau survey, however, the area has not seen a decline in overall population.

The Pensacola News Journal reported that people are choosing to stay. Residents of Mexico Beach have said that it is a real community that the people who live there are willing to rebuild. But they cannot rebuild without sufficient disaster relief aid.

Earlier this month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development granted the area $735 million more in disaster recovery funds to the affected areas through the Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery Program, a federal program that provides flexible grants to aid in recovery in disaster-stricken areas, especially in low-income areas. This money will be used to develop a State Action Plan for long-term recovery efforts due by June 1, according to a news release. 

“This funding will not only help the residents in Northwest Florida repair their homes, but also help communities rebuild stronger, and more resilient,” said Governor Ron DeSantis in the release.

These funds added to FEMA’s previously granted roughly $1 billion in disaster relief for the 12 counties most affected. So far, negotiations have been slow on how to spend the money and much of it has been inaccessible to the public.

The area is still devoid of basic needs like gas stations and grocery stores, and needs money to rebuild their homes, hospitals, and school. 

Recent satellite images of the area compared to images before the storm show that recovery is slow. The rows of beachfront homes are now skeleton graveyards of the former houses dotted with FEMA trailers, where the houses’s residents have been living for the past 16 months. The marshland surrounding the city is now sparse.

“People don’t realize how much rebuilding we’re still doing,” said Lewis.

With limited housing in the area, homelessness is high. Hurricanes, being a major driver of homlessness, has an effect on the declines in school enrollment. 

The decline in enrollment correlates with the rise in student homelessness in the area. The Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness states that housing instability may contribute to a student’s inability to attend school due to volatile commutes and housing arrangements, lack of sleep, family responsibilities and other physical or mental health issues that come from being homeless.

For example, after Hurricane Irma hit the Florida Keys in 2017, Dade County lost over 3,300 students from the 2016/2017 year to the 2017/2018 year after seeing a steady increase in students since 2009 after the effects of Gustav. Dade County includes Miami, and was granted over $200 million for disaster relief from FEMA. The amount of students lost only equated to about 1% of the county’s total student population.

However, in less lucrative areas, such as the Florida panhandle, recovery is much slower. This is the case with Hurricane Michael.

In 2008, Hurricane Gustav made landfall in southeast Louisiana and produced strong tornadoes across the panhandle. During that time, over all of the counties that make up the panhandle, the public school enrollment rate saw a steady decline with an average of -2.33% over three years from 2008 to 2011. 

It took the panhandle school systems three times as long to recover than the more lucrative Dade County.

In years when hurricanes did not affect Florida, the data showed that the enrollment rate has remained stable or had seen steady increases across all counties. Despite the Hurricane Michael relief efforts and the dip in enrollments, Florida’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research forecasted enrollment rates to follow that steady increase through the 2024/2025 school year in a report released last week.

When the hurricane hit the Forgotten Coast, Lewis was trapped in his office building in Panama City. Luckily, his house was fine. He said his building was completely destroyed, but that being part of Nexstar Media Group, a private corporation, they were lucky enough to have the money to rebuild a brand new one. 

“No matter if we liked or hated each other, we were bonded,” he said about the experience he had with his coworkers. The massive wind and brutal rain was “ something we would never forget.”

The name Michael has been retired as a tropical cyclone name by the World Meteorological Organization as a result of the $25.1 billion in damage and 74 recorded deaths it caused.
